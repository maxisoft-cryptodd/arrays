First my pov is that it focus too much on mimic zarr stuff.

while this lib should be generic, it should first impl the main feature:
save in a compressed way orderbook and other arrays, and the main performance bottleneck is to retrive those at super speed ! (hence zstd, lz4).

the goal here is to have performance first ! we can and should get rid of old zarr impl, we are free and have space to optimize every thing.

to do so, there's many adv technique, already impl in zarr code but we can go beyond:
use state of the art, avx/arm instructions, note that they should be optional and the code must have optimized loop for avx1, 2, 512 and so on. this is going to be a lot of code !
maybe the boilerplate will be reduced using https://github.com/google/highway

also as target, use avx1 as base, msvc and gcc support needed.

use of vcpkg is mandatory.

for now the goal is to build a shared or static lib and load it via python.
also for later a probable binding via pybind11 or cython or other is possible.

but with the help of ai and generative model should be handlable.


first, the main thing to focus is orderbook performance as it's the very one bottleneck and it's shape outweight all others.

i repeat, do not focus on reproduction zarr impl but on speed.
you may add generic array handling and stuff but it's a feature not the base to build around.

more details:

okx orderbook are shaped as (N, 50, 3) so use this to create a specific handling; optimize loop and datastorage for this very shape.
as using simd this is way superior.
for instance use multi xor startup point for very fast simd like:

start reading 4 (or better, according to avx1 or 2) float32, (potentially cast to float16 then uint16) then xor using simd.
note that doing so need to store the 4 to provide correct reconstruction for later.

using c++23 give access to the std::float16_t type, great isn't ?

create a code loop for this specific case, also for the raw ob (without float16 downcasting)

then redo for a loop for generic (N, D, F), to handle all ob case.


# about the file:
use a magic, a version.
user metadata is user provided as byte, no need json. lib maybe agnostic of the user provided metadata. compress them using zstd
write as uint32 length, followed by the compressed blob.
if length is 0 then no metadata.

the file is a binary store that store everything (data, metadata).
the file is only write, read or append mode, never append data "in between".

instead of doing like zarr small file, we can build a one file per symbol or split it manually as user needed per time.
also the chunk size is dynamic, focus only on the first dim, the time dim for simplicity and speed.
ideally it should represent around 4 Ko of compressed data. for super fast reading. and should be configured by the user and the data needs.


we need to store each chunk metadata like such:

MAGIC;
VERSION;
METADATA;
USER_META;
CHUNK_OFFSETS;
CHUNKS...
CHUNK_OFFSETS;
CHUNKS...
...


## about CHUNK_OFFSETS
chunk offset are like a array of "pointers" to the data; initially set according to the user param (or compute/default if not set).
the last elements of this array is a special one that allow one to append more data, it point, if set, to another CHUNK_OFFSETS extended,
that define other chunks and so on.
so there's a need for a balance between this array length and having many other CHUNK_OFFSETS in the file later,
hence use a good default and allow the user to specify it.
for future dev, compat use soemthing like:

CHUNK_OFFSETS = [uint32 size, uint16 type, uint64[2] hash, uint64 first_chunk, uint64 second, ..., uint64 next_extended_chunk_offsets]

hence when appending more data, those CHUNK_OFFSETS need to be updated.
type is for two type for now:
RAW_CHUNK_OFFSET store directly the chunks
LZ4_CHUNK_OFFSET store a compressed array of the chunks
note that if len(lz4_comp(chunk_array)) > len(chunk_array)) then store as raw
hash is BLAKE3 hash of all offset values.

# about CHUNKS

CHUNKS = [uint32 size, uint16 type, uint16 dtype, uint64[2] hash, uint64 flags, uint32[1...8] shape, data...]

shape is like a c string: numbers array and when it ends with 0 this is then end of shape numbers.
type is like ZSTD_COMPRESSED, GENERIC_OB_COMPRESSED, OKX_OB_COMPRESSED, ..., RAW_DATA,
dtype is float16, float32, uint32, int64 and so on...
flags is only used for now for:
LZ4: 1
ZSTD: 1 << 1
LITTLE_ENDIAN = 1 << 2
BIG_ENDIAN = 1 << 3 // not impl if swaping endianess needed.
DOWN_CAST_8 = 1 << 4 // not impl but for future proof
DOWN_CAST_16 = 1 << 5
DOWN_CAST_32 = 1 << 6 // not impl
DOWN_CAST_64 = 1 << 7 // not impl
DOWN_CAST_128 = 1 << 8 // not impl

RESERVED = 1 << 63 // for future (like extend this flag to 128 bit reading)



# about the non file:

also the impl must handle non file, in memory store. abstraction may be welcome here.

# the api

# creating
allow the user to write data by appending chunk
allow the user to specify detailled params

# query
allow the user to get it's metadata
count the num of chunks
get chunks sizes
allow the user to get a chunk by it's index.
allow the user to get a array from slice(start,end)

So there'll be a file for ob, one for time one for normalized price and so on.
specialized need to be impl for each known shape and feature

about the questions:

> On Compatibility: Gemini's plan presumes strict Zarr v3 compatibility. This ensures other tools can read our data, which is a safe bet. However, are there any advantages to a custom, potentially more optimized binary format if we are the sole consumer? How critical is interoperability?

indeed go for speed

> On Project Scope: Is the primary goal only to solve the data loader bottleneck, or should we view this C++ library as a foundational component for future C++-native data processing and feature engineering pipelines? The answer will influence how much we invest in the abstraction layers.

both: c++ abstraction is needed indeed at many level. while perf is first goal, state of art, good code is always good to go.

> On Migration: The plans focus on writing new data. What is our strategy for the terabytes of existing Zarr data? Will this C++ library need a read-only mode for existing Zarr v2/v3 stores, or will we perform a one-time migration of all data to a new, C++-written format?

for now the goal is for the new data, but later for the terabytes, hence the need of configuration, abstraction and generalisation.
later even for a c# code part, will use this library.
even later (not this score) for two cli command helper: reader and appender

> On the Concurrency Model: Our Python code is heavily asyncio-based. Gemini suggests wrapping the blocking C++ calls with asyncio.to_thread. This is viable, but is it optimal? Should the C++ library itself be designed with an asynchronous core (e.g., using C++20 Coroutines, Boost.Asio, or a callback system) to provide a more native async interface to Python?

yes cpp code should use async, coroutine.
optionally and configurably multithreaded (https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB).
and also let the end user decide to use internal tbb or external one by himself.
also consider the existing code to use asyncio.to_thread for those compression.

> On the Codec Interface: I strongly recommend we adopt Cline's more formal ICodec interface, separating array-to-array filters from byte-to-byte compressors. Do you agree that this level of architectural rigor is worthwhile for long-term maintainability?

whatever, we'll see that. perf is key.

> On Dependency Management: Are you comfortable with the proposed third-party dependencies (pybind11, nlohmann/json, zstd, lz4)? Do we have any constraints, like a preference for header-only libraries or specific versions?

use vcpkg, compat with windows (msvc, mingw) and linux. using both x64 and arm64 or armhf.
c++23 support is not that good in msvc, but i've the latest one. no need to worry about too much.

> On Error Handling: Neither plan details this. How should errors from deep within the C++ layer (e.g., a disk I/O failure, a corrupt chunk, a failed decompression) be propagated to the Python caller? Should we use custom, serializable C++ exception types that are translated into specific Python exceptions?

Duno, never wrote a pybind11


> On the MVP: What is the most critical first deliverable? Is it a high-performance reader to immediately accelerate the OkxOrderBookDataset, or is it a robust writer to build the foundation of the pipeline? I suspect the reader is the highest priority for immediate impact.

reader, but to read, i've to write the data first :)

> On Validation & Testing: How will we gain confidence that the C++ implementation is correct? My proposal is to implement a "dual-write" mode in the pipeline temporarily and perform a bit-for-bit comparison of the compressed chunks generated by both the Python zarr library and our new C++ library for the same input data. Do you have a different validation strategy in mind?

use executable that test with dummy data (or read from a real file) to compress.
